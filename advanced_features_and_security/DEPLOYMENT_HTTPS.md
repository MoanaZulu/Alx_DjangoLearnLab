# Deployment Configuration for HTTPS

## SSL/TLS Setup
- Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., via Let's Encrypt).
- Configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to use HTTPS.

### Example Nginx Configuration




## Notes
- All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
- Certificates must be renewed regularly (e.g., every 90 days for Let's Encrypt).
